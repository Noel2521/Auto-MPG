Basic Neural Networks for the beginners to practice 
# Auto MPG Prediction with TensorFlow

This repository contains a TensorFlow project for predicting the fuel efficiency (MPG) of cars using a neural network. The dataset used for training is the Auto MPG dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Overview

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Importing Libraries**: Importing necessary Python libraries like TensorFlow, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

2. **Loading and Preprocessing Data**: Loading the Auto MPG dataset, handling missing values, creating one-hot encodings, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data using Seaborn to understand the relationships between MPG and other features.

4. **Data Normalization**: Normalizing the data to improve model training performance.

5. **Building the Neural Network Model**: Defining and compiling a neural network model using TensorFlow's Keras API.

6. **Training the Model**: Training the model on the training dataset and monitoring the training progress.

7. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the model on the test dataset and visualizing the performance using Matplotlib.
